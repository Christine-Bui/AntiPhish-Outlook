once u download the github, run the run.bat file, it'll download all the pip install stuff that you need to run the files and should automatically open the outlook and run the python file at the same time. make sure to edit the path in the bat file to wherever the folder before u run it though. once u open an email, click on the 3 dots at the top and it should say detect phishing which will open the extension. you can also rightclick it and click on pin to ribbon to keep it at the top bar so u dont have to click the 3 dots everytime.
